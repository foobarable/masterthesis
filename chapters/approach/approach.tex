\section{Improving Task Tree Generation}
Find similar sequences with bioinformatics algorithms

\section{Alignments}
What are alignments? Why do aligmnents help here?

Simple examples of alignment here

\section{Substitution matrix}
What are they good for? How are they created? In Biology popular matrices are generated from real DNA data (PAM, BLOSUM)



\section{Needleman Wunsch Algorithm}
Very popular algorithm, finds global alignment (from start to end of both sequences)

Steps:

\subsection{Intialization}:
Fill first row and first col with gappenalty*index of position

\subsection{Recursion}
Build dynamic programmic matrix: Fill each field with this recursion formula

\subsection{Traceback}
Go back from last cell to first cell to get final alignment



\section{Smith Waterman Algorithm}
Similar to needleman wunsch algorithm, finds best local alignment

\subsection{Intialization}:
Fill first row and first col with 0

\subsection{Recursion}
Build dynamic programmic matrix: Fill each field with this sligtly modified recursion formula

\subsection{Traceback}
Go back from highest score cell to first cell that has 0 



\section{Smith Waterman Algorithm with repeated matches}
Finds all local alignments of two sequences that reach a threshold score


\subsection{Intialization}:
Fill first col with 0, first row has a different meaning in this algorithm (score of the last matched subsequence)

\subsection{Recursion}
Build dynamic programmic matrix: Fill each field with this again sligtly modified recursion formula

\subsection{Traceback}
Go back from the addition cell in the first row to first cell to get alignment

\section{Sequence Generation}
Sequences generated in the first step of the sequencefortaskdetection rule. (Harmonizing the events)
Each distinct event gets a unique id which will be used in the algorithms. 

\section{Subsitution Matrices}

Model of how similar events are

So far determined by distance in the gui model

Other possibilities: XY-coordinates distance


\section{Task Tree Generation}
Generate Pairwise alignment of all sequences with smith-waterman-repeated algorithm

Find important sub-sequences that reach a certain threshold in the smith-waterman-repeated

Find the matches that occur most often in all other matches(or sequences, not sure yet)

Create Tasks of those matches and substitute this tasks in each sequence it can be found

Task trees are a method to describe and structure the process of users interacting with software. 
The designer of the software can generate a task tree from the GUI model e.g. from HTML structure. In contradiction to the task trees generated at design time they can also be derived from recorded user actions. In this case, task trees offer the possibility to semi-automatically evaluate the usability of the software since it is then possible to compare expected with the actual user behaviour \citep{harms2013}.  

\begin{itemize}
	\item Definition of a task tree: type of task model which describe user actions
    	\begin{itemize}
		\item  e.g. used in Goals, Operators, Methods and Selection Rules (GOMS), TaskMODL and ConcurTastTrees (Zitat?)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Aim: analyze and compare effective and expected user interactions, semi-automatic usability evaluation
	\item two possible variants of task tree generation 
 	\begin{itemize}
		\item - generated from expected actions at design time
      		\begin{itemize}
			\item Tools/Software: Critique, ReverseAllUI (based on models of GUI) (sources...)
     			\item Problem: simplified or complete task tree
		\end{itemize}
		\item Actual user interactions (e.g. from event driven software)
     		\begin{itemize} 
			\item Programming by example: effective user actions recorded
			\item Problem: usability improved only on a local area
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\item Harms tries to get a more global view on software: usability could be improved by that (cite) 
	\item Disadvantages from harms method here!
	\item In this work I will cover the following aspects...
\end{itemize}


\section{Terminology}
	The basic building blocks of a task tree are ..
\begin{itemize} 
	
	\item Components of a task tree: (with picture)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item root node: represents the overall task which contains all subtasks, the user wants to "reach" this node by his actions/his input
		\begin{itemize}
    			\item Order something in a webshop
		\end{itemize}
		\item intermediate nodes: subtasks which are steps towards the overall task
		\begin{itemize}
			\item e.g.: create a new account/log in, put something into the basket
		\end{itemize}
		\item leaf nodes: actions (e.g. click, scroll, textinput) which cause an event (e.g. \textit{onclick} (click) or \textit{onchange} (textinput)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item e.g.: enter a product name in a text field and click on the "search"-button
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\item Where should i write about the difference between tasks and taskinstances? 	
	\item temporal relationship: the order of the executed actions is important, so it is saved in the task tree
	\item different ways of temporal relationship used by harms: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item sequences: children executed in specific order
		\item iteration: only one child, executed zero or more times
		\item selection: only one of the children is executed
		\item optional:  only one child, executed once or not
	\end{itemize}	
	\item Trace: recorded sequence of events: monitoring module records events caused by user actions, stored 
	\item add example of a trace (maybe this goes to case study)
\end{itemize}
\section{Trace Based Task Tree Generation by Harms}
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Procedure: start with leaf nodes to creat a task tree
 	\item for every event in a trace: crate an event task instance
  	\item event tasks instances stored in recorded order

	\item Iteration detection:
	\begin{itemize} 
		\item identical tasks, which often repeat directly (e.g.: click on the same button a few times): Iteration
		\item generate a new task model of type iteration: iterated event task as single child
		\item replace every occured iteration of the event task with the iteration task node 
	\end{itemize}

	\item Sequence detection:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item task list scanned for identical subsequences
    		\item most occured and longest subsequence: propably a logical and useful subtask
		\item new task node type sequence generated
		\item every identical subsequence replaced with the new task node 
		\item if same length and count of subsequence: first subsequence will be replaced (always only one subsequence replaced!
    		\item minimal length of a subsequence: 2 actions/ event tasks
	\end{itemize}
	\item Repetition of Detections:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item iteration and sequence detection repeatet until there are no matches anymore
  		\item replaced sequences may already contain iterations/sequences 
		\item in the end: list with task trees and event tasks that does not fit in as an iteration or sequence
		\item Problem: some event tasks are used only once (e.g. login) or very seldom by one user
		\item solution: compare data of more users 
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In this chapter I will provide and explain the concepts and terms that are used throughout this thesis. 
I will cover the definitions of a GUI and GUI-Model as well as the basic terminology of a task tree. 
After that some information about string algorithms used in biology and the utilities needed by them is given.
The last section describes the method for tasktree generation by Harms et al. \cite{harms2013}


\section{GUI and GUI-Model}
\label{sec:foundationguiandguimodel}
GUI is short for graphical user interface which is an interface that is used to issue commands to a computer by means of a device such as a mouse that manipulates and activates onscreen images.\cite{Dictionary.com2014}

\section{Task Tree Terminology}
\label{sec:foundationtasktreeterminology}
	The basic building blocks of a task tree are ..
\begin{itemize} 
	
	\item Components of a task tree: (with picture)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item root node: represents the overall task which contains all subtasks, the user wants to "reach" this node by his actions/his input
		\begin{itemize}
    			\item Order something in a webshop
		\end{itemize}
		\item intermediate nodes: subtasks which are steps towards the overall task
		\begin{itemize}
			\item e.g.: create a new account/log in, put something into the basket
		\end{itemize}
		\item leaf nodes: actions (e.g. click, scroll, textinput) which cause an event (e.g. \textit{onclick} (click) or \textit{onchange} (textinput)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item e.g.: enter a product name in a text field and click on the "search"-button
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\item Where should i write about the difference between tasks and taskinstances? 	
	\item temporal relationship: the order of the executed actions is important, so it is saved in the task tree
	\item different ways of temporal relationship used by harms: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item sequences: children executed in specific order
		\item iteration: only one child, executed zero or more times
		\item selection: only one of the children is executed
		\item optional:  only one child, executed once or not
	\end{itemize}

		        text centered, anchor=west, text=black, fill=blue!25]

		      child [missing] {}
		          child [missing] {}
		    }
		        child [missing] {}
		    child [missing] {}
		        child { node {Sequence}
		          child { node {click        on   Textfield "password"}}
		          child { node {Enter password  into Textfield "password"}}
		        }
		      }
		    }
		    child [missing] {}
		    child [missing] {}
		    child [missing] {}
		    child [missing] {}
		    child [missing] {}
		    child [missing] {}
		    child [missing] {}
		    child { node {Click        on   Button "login"}};
		%    child [missing] {}               
		%    child [missing] {}               
		%    child [missing] {}
		\end{tikzpicture}

	\item Trace: recorded sequence of events: monitoring module records events caused by user actions, stored 
	\item add example of a trace (maybe this goes to case study)
\end{itemize}

\section{Alignments}
What are alignments? 
\begin{itemize}
	\item String algorithm often used in bioinformatics 
	\item arranging sequences of DNA, RNA, Peptids to identify meaningful regions.
	\item Meaningful regions are conserved, little mutations in sequences
	\item Representation: Sequences in rows, aligned 
	\item Minimal example of two aligned sequences here (with gaps though)
	\item 2 Main categories: global and local alignments 
	\item global: find best alignment end to end: better for very similar sequences
	\item local: find best alignment of subsequence: better for finding conserved regions of not so similar sequences
	\item Basic Algorithms: NeedleMan Wunsch(global), Smith Waterman(local) 
\end{itemize} 


\section{Substitution Matrixes}
\label{sec:foundationsubstitutionmatrix}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Representation of how similar two elements in a sequence are. 
		\item Alignment algorithms use this information to arrange the two sequences 
		\item Usually symmetric matrices where each cell represents how good or bad it is to substitute element a with element b  
	\end{itemize}
	\paragraph{Biological background}
	In Biology popular matrices are generated from real DNA data (PAM, BLOSUM) (cite)


\section{State of the Art of Trace Based Task Tree Generation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Procedure: start with leaf nodes to creat a task tree
 	\item for every event in a trace: create an event task instance
  	\item event tasks instances stored in recorded order

	\item Iteration detection:
	\begin{itemize} 
		\item identical tasks, which often repeat directly (e.g.: click on the same button a few times): Iteration
		\item generate a new task model of type iteration: iterated event task as single child
		\item replace every occured iteration of the event task with the iteration task node 
	\end{itemize}

	\item Sequence detection:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item task list scanned for identical subsequences
    		\item most occured and longest subsequence: propably a logical and useful subtask
		\item new task node type sequence generated
		\item every identical subsequence replaced with the new task node 
		\item if same length and count of subsequence: first subsequence will be replaced (always only one subsequence replaced!
    		\item minimal length of a subsequence: 2 actions/ event tasks
	\end{itemize}
	\item Repetition of Detections:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item iteration and sequence detection repeatet until there are no matches anymore
  		\item replaced sequences may already contain iterations/sequences 
		\item in the end: list with task trees and event tasks that does not fit in as an iteration or sequence
		\item Problem: some event tasks are used only once (e.g. login) or very seldom by one user
		\item solution: compare data of more users 
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
